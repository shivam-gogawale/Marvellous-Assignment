# 1: Write a Python program to implement a class named BookStore with the following specifications:

# The class should contain two instance variables:
#     -Name (Book Name)
#     -Author (Book Author)
# The class should contain one class variable:
#     -NoOfBooks (initialize it to 0)
#     -Define a constructor (init) that accepts Name and Author and initializes instance variables.
#     -Inside the constructor, increment the class variable NoOf Books by 1 whenever a new object is created.
# Implement an instance method:
#     -Display() should display book details in the format:
#     -<BookName> by <Author>. No of books: <NoOfBooks>
# Example usage:
#     -Obj1 BookStore ("Linux System Programming", "Robert Love")
#     -Objl. Display() # Linux System Programming by Robert Love. No of books: 1

#     -Obj2 BookStore ("C Programming", "Dennis Ritchie")
#     -Obj2.Display() # C Programming by Dennis Ritchie. No of books: 2


class BookStore():
    NoOfBooks = 0
    def __init__(self,BName,BAuthor):
        self.Name = BName
        self.Author = BAuthor
        BookStore.NoOfBooks = BookStore.NoOfBooks + 1

    def Display(self):
        print(f'{self.Name} by {self.Author}. No of books : {BookStore.NoOfBooks}')


obj1 = BookStore("Linux System Programming", "Robert Love")
obj1.Display()

obj2 = BookStore("C Programming", "Dennis Ritchie")
obj2.Display()
